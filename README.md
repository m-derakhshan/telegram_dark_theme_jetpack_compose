# Telegram dark theme using jetpack_compose
Previously I implemented telegram dark theme animation without jetpack compose. A few days ago, one of my connections on LinkedIn posted a video about the implementation of dark telegram mode using jetpack compose. He didn't publish his approach because he implemented that for his company. So now I implemented it. 
It is dedicated to the open-source community, with *LOVE*!
